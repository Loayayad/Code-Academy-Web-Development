Codecademy solution code for X-Press-Publishing

To check your own work, or if you get stuck, you can download the X-Press Publishing Solution Code. To run the app, you’ll need to npm install, but the database file is included, so you shouldn’t need to run the migration or seed file.

Remember, our solution is only one way to implement the Expresso API and pass the tests. Your solution may use a different file, router structure, or logic within each route.
