How to Backtrack in Git

-git show HEAD //the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit. 
-git checkout HEAD filename  //will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit. (undo for the file)
-git reset HEAD filename //unstage that file from the staging area (remove the file from the next commit)
-git reset commit_SHA  //This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit.
enables you to rewind to the part before you made the wrong turn

return the commit then return the files in it
