Basic Git Workflow

-git init   //init means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.
-git status    //check the status
-git add filename   //add a file to the staging area 
-git diff filename // check the differences between the working directory and the staging area 
-git commit -m  //commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.
-git log  // ommits are stored chronologically in the repository and can be viewed 

to push the project in github
-git remote add origin https://github.com/Loayayad/git_practice.git
-git push -u origin master
