-git clone remote_location clone_name
remote_location tells Git where to go to find the remote. This could be a web address
clone_name is the name you give to the directory in which Git will clone the repository. 
-git remote -v  //see a list of a Git project’s remotes the origins
-git fetch  //his command will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository. It brings those changes onto what’s called a remote branch. 
-git push origin your_branch_name  // push your branch up to the remote, origin
