DELETE is the HTTP method verb used to delete resources. Because DELETE routes delete currently existing data, their paths should usually end with a route parameter to indicate which resource to delete.

Express uses .delete() as its method for DELETE requests.

Servers often send a 204 No Content status code if deletion occurs without error.
