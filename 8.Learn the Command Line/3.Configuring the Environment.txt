$ nano hello.txt
nano is a command line text editor. It works just like a desktop text editor like TextEdit or Notepad, except that it is accessible from the command line and only accepts keyboard input.

$ nano ~/.bash_profile

the name of file used to store environment settings. It is commonly called the “bash profile”. When a session starts, it will load the contents of the bash profile before executing commands.

The ~ represents the user’s home directory.

The . indicates a hidden file.

The name ~/.bash_profile is important, since this is how the command line recognizes the bash profile.

The command nano ~/.bash_profile opens up ~/.bash_profile in nano.

The text echo "Welcome, Jane Doe" creates a greeting in the bash profile, which is saved. It tells the command line to echo the string “Welcome, Jane Doe” when a terminal session begins.

The command source ~/.bash_profile activates the changes in ~/.bash_profile for the current session. Instead of closing the terminal and needing to start a new session, source makes the changes available right away in the session we are in.

alias pd="pwd"  through nano ~/.bash_profile

The alias command allows you to create keyboard shortcuts, or aliases, for commonly used commands. 


history 
the command line outputs a history of commands that were entered in the current session. 

export USER="Loay"   through nano ~/.bash_profile

to call it  echo $USER 

environment variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs and hold information about the environment.

export PS1=">> " 
sets the command prompt variable and exports the variable. Here we change the default command prompt from $ to >>.


echo $HOME 
This returns the value of the HOME variable. 

PATH is an environment variable that stores a list of directories separated by a colon.


The env command stands for “environment”, and returns a list of the environment variables for the current user.


env | grep PATH is a command that displays the value of a single environment variable.


The less command is similar to cat, but is better adapted to handling larger files. It displays files in the terminal one page at a time.


The -N option adds line numbers to the file.
